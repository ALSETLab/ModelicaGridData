## Example on Data Extraction from `*.hdf5` file

The following is an example illustrating how to extract data from an `*.hdf5` file produced after running the module `extract`. For the sake of reproducibility, the `*.hdf5` file accompanying the following example is made available under `./data`.

#### Prerequisites

Besides a Python installation, you need to install `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `hdf5` to reproduce the results of this example. All of these libraries can be set up via `pip` by the following command:

```python
pip install numpy && pip install matplotlib && pip install h5py
```
